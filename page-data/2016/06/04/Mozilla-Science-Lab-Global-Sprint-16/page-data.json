The project is being maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/ethanwhite\">Ethan White</a>, an associate professor at the University of Florida and <a href=\"https://github.com/henrykironde\">Henry Senyondo</a>. They were <a href=\"https://github.com/weecology/retriever/issues/491\">very helpful</a> in getting me familiar with the project and helping me make my <a href=\"https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/499\">first contribution</a>. They've also lined up a few more interesting contributions that I can make post the sprint.</p>\n<p>I am grateful to the Mozilla Science Lab and for all the people who took part in this massive event.
