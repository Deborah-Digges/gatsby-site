title: Lane Detection
---

The first project in the Self Driving Car Nanodegree was the detection and marking of lane lines on a video stream obtained from a camera mounted on the front of a car.

The lessons introduced in stages the basics of image processing and a few techniques like color selection, region of interest selection, gaussian blurring, edge detection using the Canny algorithm and line detection using Hough transforms.
