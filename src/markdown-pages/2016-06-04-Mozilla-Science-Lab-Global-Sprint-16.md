title: Mozilla Science Lab Global Science Sprint '16
---
On the 2nd and 3rd of June, the Mozilla Science Lab organized its annual [Global Science Sprint](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/global-sprint-2016), which brought together people from across the globe&mdash;over 35 sites&mdash;to collaborate on a variety of projects across different tracks like Tools, Open Data, and Educational Resources. 

The turnout was tremendous&mdash;contributions came in [rapidly](http://mozsprint.herokuapp.com/) and people were really excited about it.

I contributed in a small way to two projects: [The EcoData Retriever](https://github.com/weecology/retriever) and [pmc-ref](https://github.com/RobSullivan/pmc-ref).
EcoData Retriever is a project that eases the life of ecologists by downloading ecological data, pre-processing it and installing it into common databases like mysql and postgres. The project is being maintained by [Ethan White](https://github.com/ethanwhite), an associate professor at the University of Florida and [Henry Senyondo](https://github.com/henrykironde). They were [very helpful](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/issues/491) in getting me familiar with the project and helping me make my [first contribution](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/499). They've also lined up a few more interesting contributions that I can make post the sprint.

I am grateful to the Mozilla Science Lab and for all the people who took part in this massive event. Open Science for the win!
