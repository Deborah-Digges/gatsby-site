Either way, I can’t remember <em>where</em> I’ve written down the things I need to remember, let alone remember what I actually need to remember!</p>\n<p>To ease this menace, I went about writing a little command line To Do list that'll tell me what I need to do when I ask it.</p>\n<p>Here’s a sample run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ todo add Go to XYZ\n\n$ todo add Meet Phil\n\n$ todo\n1. Go to XYZ\n2. Meet Phil\n\n$ todo del\nWhat’ve you done old (wo)man?\n------\n1. Go to XYZ\n2. Meet Phil\n------\n1\n\n$ todo\n1. Meet Phil\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's what <code>todo</code> can do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>todo add &#x3C;thing to be done></code> will add an entry to your To Do list. </li>\n<li><code>todo del</code> will ask you which entry to remove from your To Do list.</li>\n<li><code>todo</code> will show you the things you need to do.</li>\n<li><code>todo help</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s pretty simple but it has helped me immensely.
