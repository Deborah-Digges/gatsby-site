title: Beginning the Self Driving Car Nanodegree
---

I've enrolled in Udacity's [Self Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/drive) and I'm in the October cohort that begins in about 20 minutes.

I'm really looking forward to this course, which aims to teach the skills relevant to building a self driving car like Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control, Path Planning and many more(Of course, I have no idea what most of these are).

See you on the other side!
