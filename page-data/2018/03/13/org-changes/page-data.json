Heralding change is not an easy job, so one can't blame them, but such encounters always leave me with a bittersweet aftertaste. </p>\n<p>The changes are usually one of three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Somebody important in our direct line of reporting has decided to leave the company or move to a different department</li>\n<li>Some work we have done is being transitioned to a sister team in another site</li>\n<li>Some group of people is being let go of because of shifts in organizational priorities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While all these are things are probably carefully thought through, one can't remove the feeling of personal loss that comes with such changes. If a leader you look up to has decided to move on, you may feel demotivated. Having something you've worked tirelessly on being handed over to another team can make you feel like you're giving up some part of yourself. The worst type is definitely having people you've worked with closely being moved around or asked to leave; that hits closest home.</p>\n<p>It's not possible to leave everyone in the shell-shocked conference room happy with organizational changes. A company needs to continuously evolve by embracing change to survive. I just wonder if there's some better way to go about these public announcements without leaving people feeling like they're just pawns in the grander scheme of things. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Did Someone Say Org Change?"},"fields":{"date":"2018-03-13","slug":"2018/03/13/org-changes/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2018/03/13/org-changes/","date":"2018-03-13"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
